In the previous chapter, we discussed two different uses of the object keyword. In the global scope,
it creates a Singleton object. When used together with the companion keyword inside of a class, it
creates a place for defining static functions. The same keyword can also be used to generate anonymous
classes. Anonymous classes are classes that are created on the fly, usually to implement an
interface in an ad-hoc manner.
